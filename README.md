# AQUA

This is the monorepo for all AQUA components.

## Guide du routard

TBD, description of the components held within this repo.

## Older versions

At some point in the future, I'd also like to clean up all previous versions of AQUA and bring their history into this repo.
What's in here currently would then be rebased on top of the old history.

This could be done either by keeping this repo, either by hijacking `aqua-kos` (as it's been around the longest) and deleting this one.

The histories between `AQUA-3.x-SDL-window-KOS` and `aqua-kos` don't overlap so they are fine, but `SDL2-AQUA-KOS` was developed at some point in parallel to `aqua-kos` for some reason.
It seems like this turned into something similar to what would become `aqua-unix` however so maybe that could count towards its history.
